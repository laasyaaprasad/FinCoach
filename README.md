Summary: The project, FinCoach, addresses a critical gap in personal finance management, where traditional tools often fail to keep up with the rapidly changing and complex demands of modern financial planning. This challenge results in delayed, inaccurate, or generalized advice, which can hinder individuals from making optimal financial decisions. Leveraging advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), FinCoach aims to develop an AI-driven financial advisory tool capable of delivering real-time, personalized financial insights that cater to individual needs in areas like budgeting, investment analysis, and risk assessment.

Project Goals and Background: The primary objective is to create a scalable, AI-powered financial assistant that provides expert-level financial guidance in real time. By fine-tuning LLMs on financial data, FinCoach delivers targeted advice for personal finance tasks, including credit management, investment strategies, and savings optimization. This project seeks to democratize access to high-quality financial advice, making it accessible to a broader audience, regardless of their financial literacy.

Research Questions and Hypotheses:

    Question: How can LLMs improve the accuracy and timeliness of financial advice?
        Hypothesis: Fine-tuning on financial datasets enhances the model’s contextual relevance, enabling it to offer precise, tailored recommendations.
    Question: Can QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) achieve efficient fine-tuning without high computational costs?
        Hypothesis: Using QLoRA enables rapid adaptation to financial contexts, providing accurate, resource-efficient advice and making the model scalable.

Related Work and Datasets FinCoach builds on recent research in financial AI, particularly in real-time data retrieval and language processing, using advanced methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to improve accuracy and responsiveness. Two primary datasets serve as the foundation:

    Alpaca News API: Real-time financial news data that keeps the model up-to-date with market trends.
    Hugging Face Finance-Alpaca Dataset: A question-answer dataset focused on finance to train the model on common financial inquiries, providing it with essential background knowledge.

Methods The development of FinCoach involves data collection, preprocessing, fine-tuning, and deployment. After data cleaning and embedding, the processed data is stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval. LoRA is used to fine-tune the model to specialize in financial topics, ensuring responses remain relevant and contextually accurate. The model is then deployed using a RESTful API, with Gradio providing an intuitive user interface for interactions.

Results Preliminary results indicate that FinCoach successfully provides accurate, real-time financial advice tailored to individual queries. The combination of LLM fine-tuning and real-time retrieval enables a responsive, contextually aware financial assistant that adapts to dynamic user needs. This tool demonstrates the potential to make expert financial advice more accessible, empowering users to make informed decisions with ease and efficiency.

Methods and Technical Implementation:

    Data Collection: Financial data is collected from two key sources—the Alpaca News API, which provides real-time financial news articles, and the Hugging Face finance-alpaca dataset, a question-answer dataset focused on finance. These sources supply diverse and current financial information essential for building a reliable, contextually aware financial advisory model.
    Data Processing: Raw financial data undergoes thorough cleaning and preprocessing to prepare it for model training. Text normalization standardizes the data by removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and handling punctuation for consistency. Tokenization breaks down text data into tokens to facilitate embedding and storage in the vector database, enabling quick access to relevant information during model inference.
    Modeling: Fine-tuning with LoRA adjusts a minimal set of parameters that allow the model to specialize in financial contexts without requiring complete retraining. Performance tracking is continuously monitored using Comet, a machine learning experiment management tool that tracks metrics and validates fine-tuning accuracy.
    Model Deployment: The fine-tuned model is deployed via a RESTful API, integrated with Gradio, providing real-time accessibility for user interaction. This setup allows users to interact smoothly with the model, which is capable of delivering instant, customized financial advice based on user input and real-time data retrieval.

Functionality of the Financial Advisory Tool FinCoach begins with data ingestion, followed by cleaning and embedding for storage. LoRA fine-tunes the model, enabling it to provide context-aware financial insights, while real-time data retrieval architecture ensures that the model’s responses incorporate the latest information. The integration of real-time data and advanced language modeling techniques makes the tool adaptable to individual user needs, offering a scalable solution for delivering reliable financial guidance.
